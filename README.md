# Forum
Forum is a web app made with Express.js using EJS templating, Bootstrap styling and connection to MongoDB for a database. In this app, you can read posts, create a new post, edit or delete it. You can also sort all posts by categories.

Through the application, I got to practice: 
- EJS Dynamic Templating
- Bootstrap
- Express.js with middleware
- RESTful APIs
- CRUD operations, HTTP GET, POST, PUT, DELETE
- Form Processing
- MongoDB & Mongoose
